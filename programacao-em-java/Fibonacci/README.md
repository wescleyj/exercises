# Fibonacci Sequence Program

This program calculates and displays the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. This program allows the user to input a number `n` and then outputs the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Enter the number of terms (`n`) you want to display.

## Example

If the user inputs `5`, the program will output:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3
```

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Basic understanding of Java programming
