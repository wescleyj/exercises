## Palindrome Checker in Java

This Java program checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).

### Example

If you enter `racecar`, the program will display `true` as the result because `racecar` is a palindrome.

If you enter `hello`, the program will display `false` as the result because `hello` is not a palindrome.
